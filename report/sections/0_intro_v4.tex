\chapter{Introduction}

The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the application of the 
Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method as a technique for reducing 
the computational cost in estimating expectations of random variables 
for two classes of parabolic stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs).

The motivation for this stems from the fact that the standard Monte Carlo 
(MC) estimator suffers from slow convergence. Its root mean square error 
(defined in section SECTION HERE) decays $O(N^{-1/2})$ where $N$ is the number 
of independent samples obtained, and therefore achieving a high accuracy 
estimate requires a high number of samples. As most SPDEs do not admit 
analytic solutions, the main approach available for estimating expectations of 
functionals of SPDEs is Monte Carlo methods. In the context
of SPDEs, obtaining samples typically requires discretising 
the spatial domain via finite difference or finite element methods
and then evolving the system to obtain the desires quantity. Accurate 
estimates requires fine discretisations, and as such, the cost of obtaining 
a sample can become expensive. This, combined with the slow convergence of the 
standard MC estimator, can make the standard Monte Carlo method prohibitively
expensive.

A number of techniques exist that aim to improve on the convergence of 
the MC estimator. Their goal is to achieve an equivalent variance in their estimate 
at a reduced computational cost. The MLMC method is one such method. 
At its heart is an approach of computing a blend of cheaper and more expensive
samples, unlike the MC estimator which uses only samples of the same cost.
Many inexpensive samples provide the bulk of the statistical signal, 
while comparitively few more costly samples then correct any residual bias.
In the context of SPDEs, this means obtaining samples using meshes at 
varying \textit{levels} of discretisation. By taking many samples at cheaper,
coarser levels and fewer at finer, more expensive levels, the MLMC 
estimator aim to achieve an estimate of equivalent accuracy at reduced cost
compared to the MC estimator.

The practical efficiency of the MLMC method however relies on correlating 
samples obtained at different levels, in a manner analogous to that of the 
control variates method \cite{giles2015multilevel} MORE CITATIONS HERE. 
This is because the cost savings is dependent on the extent to which 
samples across two adjacent levels of accuracy covary. Practically, this 
entails aligning the randomness used to generate pairs of coarse and 
fine samples. This is referred to as \textit{coupling}. 
To provide intuition as to what this means, Figure
\ref{fig:coarse_vs_fine_grid} illustrates what the finite difference 
grid used by two adjacent estimators might look like. At each 
node in these grids, a random noise is required to be generated. 
This raises a serious question: what methods are best suited to aligning the 
randomness across samples? Further, how large an impact 
can different coupling methods have?

There are three main questions this dissertation aims to answer therefore. 

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{What cost savings can MLMC achieve over standard MC in the context 
    of two parabolic SPDEs?}
    \item \textbf{What are the effects of different coupling mechanisms?}
    \item \textbf{Monte Carlo methods are embarrasingly parallelisable. What further 
    cost reductions are therefore achievable in high performance implementations 
    of these methods if we take advantage of the highly parallel nature of MC methods?}
\end{enumerate}

To answer these questions, this dissertation is structured as follows.

SECTION HERE provides the theoretical background and a review of the 
relevant literature. 
We begin by formally defining the standard MoION HERE 
To best present the answers found to these questions, this dissertation 
is structured as so. In the next section we formally present the requisite 
topics as they pertain to this investigation. This will cover 
the main theory of MLMC, a sufficiently relevant overview of SPDEs and a literature
review of the current landscape.

SECTION HERE details our numerical implementation. We describe the 
finite difference schemes used to discretise the SPDEs and, 
crucially, the specific coupling strategies employed to correlate samples between
levels. We then validate our implementation, demonstrating that it achieves 
the correct theoretical convergence rates for both the stochastic heat equation
and the Dean-Kawasaki equation.

Section SECTION HERE will then present an MLMC implementation for the 
stochastic heat equation. We  validate this implementation through a series of methods, 
varying the quantity of interest being derived, that our MLMC implementation 
converges to this and that its rate of convergence is appropriate. We then 
further validate our MLMC implementation of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, replicating 
the results of the original paper and our implementation.


Section SECTION HERE presents a comprehensive performance analysis. 
We directly address our first two research questions by comparing the 
computational cost of our MLMC implementation against a standard MC 
estimator for a range of target accuracies. Furthermore, we analyse 
the practical impact of different coupling mechanisms on overall efficiency.

Section SECTION HERE explores the potential for further cost reductions 
through high-performance computing. We discuss the design of a parallelised MLMC 
algorithm that leverages modern multi-core architectures and present performance 
metrics, such as computational speedup, to quantify the benefits of this approach.

Finally, Section SECTION HERE 
Finally, Chapter 6 concludes the dissertation. We summarise our key findings, 
revisit the initial research questions, and discuss potential avenues for future investigation.
