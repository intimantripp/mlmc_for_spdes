\chapter{Preliminary Concepts and Methods}\label{chap:preliminary}

This section presents the essential thoeretical groundwork upon which the
investigations of this dissertation is built. First, we present and develop the theory 
of the Monte Carlo (MC) and Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods, analysing their 
respective convergence and computational complexities. 

Second, we provide a concise introduction to the theory of stochastic partial differential 
equations (SPDEs). We focus on two parabolic equations which serve as our case studies: 
the Stochastic Heat Equation and the Dean-Kawasaki equation. We outline 
their mathematical formulations and briefly discuss the challenges 
associated with their numerical solutions, this being particularly pertinent to 
the Dean-Kawasaki equation.

Finally, we conclude the section with a literature rveiew. This review surveys the 
development and application of the MLMC method within the context of SPDEs, 
thereby situating the specific questions of this dissertation within the broader
research performed in this area.
