\chapter{Preliminary Concepts and Methods}\label{chap:preliminary}

This chapter presents the thoeretical groundwork upon which the
investigations of this dissertation is built. We begin by developing the theory 
of the Monte Carlo (MC) and Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) methods, analysing their 
respective convergence and computational complexities. 

Following this, we provide a concise introduction to the stochastic partial 
differential equations (SPDEs) we will focus on. We focus on two parabolic 
equations which serve as our case studies: The Stochastic Heat Equation 
and the Dean-Kawasaki equation. We outline their mathematical formulations and briefly 
discuss the challenges associated with their numerical solution, which are particularly 
pertinent to the Dean-Kawasaki equation.

The chapter concludes with a lierature review that surveys the development and application 
of the MLMC method within the context of SPDEs, situating the research questions of this 
dissertation within the broader academic landscape.
