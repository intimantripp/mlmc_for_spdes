\subsection{Multilevel Monte Carlo}

The MLMC method, introduced by Giles \cite{giles2015multilevel}, is a variance reduction technique
designed to substantially reduce the computational cost of estimating quantities arising from stochastic systems
compared to the standard Monte Carlo method.

Given some computed quantity $P$, the standard Monte Carlo estimate of $\mathbb{E}\left[P\right]$ 
is given by the average of $N$ independent samples of $P$:

\begin{equation*}
    \mathbb{E}\left[P\right] \approx \frac{1}{N} \sum_{n=1}^{N} P^{(n)} = P_{MC}
\end{equation*}

The variance of this estimate is $N^-1 \mathbb{V}\left[P\right]$, the standard error is therefore 
$O(N^{\frac{1}{2}})$ and consequently to achieve an accuracy of $\varepsilon$, $N = O(\varepsilon^{-2})$ samples 
are required.
