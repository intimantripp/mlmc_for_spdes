\chapter{Methodologies and Validation}\label{chap:method_and_validation}

This chapter details the practical methodologies and numerical validation 
that form the foundation for the investigations in this dissertation. Having 
presented the theoretical groundwork in the preceding chapter, we now 
turn to the numerical implementations.

This chapter is organised into 3 main parts. First, 
we outline the MLMC algorithm that is implemented, 
presenting the method and algorithm 
implemented in this dissertation.

Second, we focus on the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE). We begin
by defining the specific SHE problem to be analysed.
We then derive the explicit finite difference scheme 
used for its numerical solution and detail the MLMC implementation,
including the proposed noise coupling strategies. To validate 
this implementation, we apply the method to compute several 
distinct quantities of interest: Moments of the solution's
Fourier modes and its total energy. We demonstrate that our 
implementation converges to the correct, analytically 
derived values and that the various convergence, decay and 
growth rates align with those predicted by theory.

Third, we address the Dean-Kawasaki equation. Following 
the approach of Cornalba and Fischer \cite{cornalba2025multilevel}, 
we present the finite difference scheme, the specific quantity
of interest, and the MLMC implementation. We then validate our implementation
by demonstrating its convergence and proceed to examine the 
practical performance of the two distinct coupling 
strategies proposed in their work.
