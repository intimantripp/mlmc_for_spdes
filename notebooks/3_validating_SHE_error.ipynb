I discretise the spatial domain $[0,1]$ into $N+2$ points, equivalently $N+1$ subdivisions, each of width $\\Delta x = \\frac{1}{N+1}$. This means we have $N$ internal points. Each discrete spatial point is notated as $x_i$, corresponding to the $i \\Delta x = \\frac{i}{N+1}$ where $i \\in \\{0, 1, ..., N+1\\}$. Similarly, we discretise our temporal grid. We have $\\Delta t = \\lambda \\Delta x^2, \\quad t_j = j \\Delta t, \\quad j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, ...\\}$. We express our discretised points of u(x_i, t_j) using the following notation: $u(x_i, t_j) := u_i^j$. Finally, my finite volume derived scheme for the SHE is the following\n",
